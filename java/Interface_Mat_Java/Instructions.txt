Follow these steps to call InterPSS loadflow analysis from Matlab. 
I tried to make it as general (at least for Unix systems) as possible. No garantuee.
-------
1.  Change Matlab startup folder:
    - In any open matlab session, type in command window: userpath('/path_to_SFINA_at_git/java/Interface_Mat_Java').
    - Quit Matlab.
    Note: This ensures, that Matlab loads javaclasspath.txt at startup which adds neccessary java classes.
    It just changes the startup folder of Matlab and can be easily resetted with userpath('reset') later if necessary.

2.  Start Matlab with JVM 1.8 to make it compatible with InterPSS
    On Mac: 
    - Install JVM 1.8 (check your version in terminal with: java -version)
    - Open terminal
    - Find out path of JVM 1.8: /usr/libexec/java_home -V
    - export MATLAB_JAVA=<full JVM path>/jre (if JDK is installed, for JRE omit the /jre)
      e.g. export MATLAB_JAVA=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_31.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
    - navigate in the same terminal window to Applications folder and open matlab: open MATLAB_R2015a.app/
    - to check if Matlab indeed now uses Java 1.8, type in Matlab command window: version -java
    Note: Setting of the environment variable like this is limited to the current terminal window. 
    So it's necessary to start Matlab from this same window. To set it for all future windows as well, add it to .bash_profile
    On Unix it might be different, on Windows it's definitely different
	
3.  Run InterPSS powerflow analysis for IEEE 14 Bus System
    - open and run Example_call_interpss_from_matlab.m
    - don't be scared about the red output, it's not an error, just some information output from loading InterPSS
    General:
    - Type in Matlab: result = InterPSS_lf(inputpath,mode);
    - inputpath = path to case file
    - mode = 'AC' or 'DC' as a string
