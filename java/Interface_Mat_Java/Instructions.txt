Follow these steps to call InterPSS loadflow analysis from Matlab
-------
1.  Copy 

1. 	Start Matlab with JVM 1.8 to make it compatible with InterPSS
	On Mac: 
	- Install JVM 1.8
	- Open terminal
	- Find out path of JVM 1.8: /usr/libexec/java_home -V
	- export MATLAB_JAVA=<full JVM path>/jre (if JDK is installed, for JRE omit the /jre)
	  e.g. export MATLAB_JAVA=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_31.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
	- go to Applications folder in the same terminal window and open matlab with: open MATLAB_R2015a.app/
	On Unix it might be different, on Windows it's definitely different
	
2.	To make Java simulation available in Matlab
	- Copy ...
	- ...

3.	Run InterPSS powerflow analysis
	- Type in Matlab: result = InterPSS_lf(inputpath,mode);
	- inputpath = absolute path to case file
	- mode = 'AC' or 'DC' as a string
	- ...
